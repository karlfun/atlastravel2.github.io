An endowment is a gift that keeps on giving. Invested money can earn interest.

If we invest $20,000 and earn a return of 2.5%, that's $500 in income! And that could be $500 of scholarship funds we could award every year, without ever spending down the initial investment.

Help us raise our principal of $20,000 so that we can give travel scholarships every year.
