Atlas Travel Foundation is a nonprofit organization established in 2024 in Topeka, Kansas. Our Mission is to award scholarships to Shawnee County youth and young adults participating in international travel programs in order to inspire intellectual curiosity, cultivate global awareness, and build respect for other cultures.

**Travel changes people. Changed people change the world.** Travel creates global citizens: preparing the next generation; strengthening our workforce; and equipping students with skills that make them more adaptable to diverse challenges and situations. Topeka is 1,000 miles from any other country. We hope to make it a little easier for young people from our community to see a different part of the world.

Atlas Travel Foundation scholarships will be open to youth and young adults in Shawnee County applying for educational travel programs. We hope to raise a large principal sum which will serve as an endowment. This endowment will earn interest every year; from that interest we will award scholarships. Donors who support the principal investment aren't just investing in _one_ scholarship this year. They are investing in a new scholarship, every year, for as long as the foundation lives.
