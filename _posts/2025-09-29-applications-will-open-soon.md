### Scholarship applications will open soon!

Stay tuned for the opportunity to apply for the very first international travel scholarship from the Atlas Travel Foundation. Applications will be open to students living in Shawnee County who are participating in an international program in 2026. 

You'll need to share a transcript or report card, and include two letters of recommendation from your instructors. Be thinking now of who you can ask to support your application! 

[Sign up here for updates](https://mailchi.mp/8e010a4ececd/subscribe) to find out when the application goes live.
