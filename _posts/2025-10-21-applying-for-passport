## Applying for your first passport 

If you’re applying for your very first passport, you have to apply in person! You have to download the form [from the Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply.html) first, then you’ll have to turn in your form, copies of your identification, your un-smiling photo, and your payment - to an **official acceptance facility**. Luckily, we have one in Topeka, right off Lower Silver Lake Road!

The post office at 1410 NW Gage Blvd is the only place in Shawnee County that acts as an acceptance center for U.S. Passport applications. There are also acceptance facilities in Perry, St. Marys, and Lawrence, as well as other communities in Kansas. It's typically a post office, but it's not *every* post office. 

Another heads up, you'll need to schedule a time to bring your passport materials. If you need a photo, the USPS professionals can take one for you. You can also take your own but the requirements are [extremely strict](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/photos.html). It may take many tries to find a place to take the photo and to get one just right.
