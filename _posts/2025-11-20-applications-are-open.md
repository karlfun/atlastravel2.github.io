### Scholarship applications are now open!

The Atlas Travel Foundation scholarship application is now open! [Head straight to our info page if you're ready to get started](https://atlastravelfoundation.org/application/). 

You'll need to track down a couple of things before you apply; first, a PDF of your transcript or report card, and next, a letter of recommendation from one of your instructors. Beyond that, you'll be able to fill out the form yourself. 

Please make sure you have your application submitted through our form by February 15th, 2026. That's less than 90 days from now! 

We are looking forward to sending a Shawnee County student on an international trip next year! 

Ready to start? Here's our application. This will take you to the Google Form:
