excerpt: Atlas Travel Foundation met with Washburn students at the study abroad fair.

Washburn students learned about the first Atlas Travel Foundation Scholarship at Washburn University's Bowtie Event on February 4, 2025.  Foundation representatives answered questions about the scholarship, learned where students want to travel, and connected with educators who support study abroad programs.  

Students’ travel bucket lists spanned the globe, ranging from Antarctica to Iran and several locations in Europe, Central and South America.  One student said they wanted to travel “everywhere, because there is so much to see.”  Students were interested in learning about other cultures, enjoying international food, learning a new language, and seeing the natural beauty of the world.  

Educators emphasized the transformational nature of travel–it is an experience that cannot be replicated in any way other than leaving the known and the familiar, and challenges students in a way that builds resiliency for adulthood.  

You can help fund Shawnee County students’ education and transformation by supporting their participation in study abroad programs.  Consider making a [donation](https://atlastravelfoundation.org/support/) to the Atlas Travel Foundation to help Shawnee County students explore their world.  Even just a small donation can turn “I wish I could go” into “I went!”
