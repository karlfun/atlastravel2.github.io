### Giving Tuesday is here!

Traveling internationally is a life-changing opportunity that isn’t easily achievable for many students.  This Giving Tuesday, make a [donation](https://atlastravelfoundation.org/support/) to the Atlas Travel Foundation to help Shawnee County students explore their world.    

Your gift will fund the Foundation’s first scholarship to a Shawnee County high school or college student participating in a school-sponsored international trip.  Even just a small donation can turn “I wish I could go” into “ I went!”
