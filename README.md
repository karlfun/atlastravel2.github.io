This site is live on the web here: https://atlastravelfoundation.org/

The file "index.md" contains the content for the home page.

There will also be an "index.md" file inside the folder for any other main pages.

This site is built using markdown, which is a text-based editing format. Here is a great markdown cheatsheet.

Edits on the site are not instant. It takes a few minutes for edits to show up "live" on the web.
